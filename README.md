**NextJS13-based *dummy* ticketing application** -- this project is a **CRUD** app based on Net Ninja's NextJS13 tutorial. I added some changes to it and I look forward to add more changes in the future.

Some **changes** that make this project differs from its based version includes :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-use **MongoDB atlas** as database.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-edit ticket page (additional functionality).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-using **Typescript** instead of Javascript.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-subtle changes in color theme.
