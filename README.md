**NextJS23-based help desk site** -- this project is based on Net Ninja's NextJS13 tutorial and is one of my NextJS learning projects.

Some *changes* that make this project differs from its based version includes :  
	-edit ticket page (additional functionality)  
	-using Typescript instead of Javascript.   
	-subtle changes in color theme.
